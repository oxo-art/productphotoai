# Digital Ocean Docker Container Deployment Configuration

## Required Package.json Changes (Manual Step)

Add the following to your package.json scripts section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build"
  }
}
```

## Docker Container Deployment for Digital Ocean App Platform

### Deployment Steps
1. **Repository**: Connect your GitHub/GitLab repository
2. **Type**: Select "Docker" as the resource type
3. **Dockerfile Path**: Use the root Dockerfile
4. **Port**: 8080 (automatically configured)
5. **Health Check**: Built-in health check endpoint at `/`

## Environment Variables
- Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your Digital Ocean app settings
- Set `PORT=8080` (optional, defaults to 8080)

## Docker Container Features
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimized build and runtime stages
- **Express Server**: Serves built React application with client-side routing support
- **Health Checks**: Built-in endpoint monitoring at `/`
- **Production Optimized**: Minimal runtime image with only necessary dependencies
- **Auto-scaling**: Compatible with Digital Ocean's scaling features

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Build Issues
- **Build failures**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed during build stage
- **TypeScript errors**: All dev dependencies are available during build
- **Port binding**: Server binds to 0.0.0.0:8080 for container compatibility

### Runtime Issues
- Check application logs in Digital Ocean dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure health check endpoint is responding at `/`

### Performance Features
- Static assets served directly by Express
- Client-side routing handled with proper fallback
- Production builds are minified and optimized
- Horizontal scaling supported

## Build Process Summary
1. **Build Stage**: Installs all dependencies, compiles TypeScript, and builds with Vite
2. **Production Stage**: Creates minimal runtime image with Express server
3. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checks on port 8080
4. **Deployment**: Single Docker container deployment with auto-scaling support

This Docker-based approach provides the most reliable and portable deployment solution.
